# Py-Project__Healthy-Programmer
A python project that takes care of the health of the programmers by means of reminding them to drink sufficient amount of water, relax their eyes from the blue light digital screen, and perform a light free hand exercise while they busy in coding. This program can be setup to autorun in background (by task scheduler or startup folder for Windows OS).
